# Hate speech detection
### Project
Social media platforms have become the most prominent medium for spreading hate speech, primarily through hateful textual content. An extensive dataset containing emoticons, emojis, hashtags, slang, and contractions is required to detect hate speech on social media based on current trends. 

### Data
This dataset contains hate speech sentences in English and is confined into two classes, one representing hateful content and the other representing non-hateful content. 

### Objective
It is required to implement a machine learning model for detecting hate texts to block such users on the platform.

### Infrastructure
Interaction of services for retraining the model and deploying the API of the service
